It's a project to run a solar focuser.
the solar focuser is a satelite tv antenna full of little mirrors the focus the 
solar beans to a small point (probably gonna have a solar pannel on the focal point)

to start I'm making a small version that olny followns the ligth like a sunflower 
using a esp32, its possible to have simultaneous moviment in both axis.
